# INITIAL FITTING PARAMETERS
#
#   For component type, the allowed functions are: 
#       sersic, expdisk, edgedisk, devauc, king, nuker, psf, 
#       gaussian, moffat, ferrer, and sky. 
#  
#   Hidden parameters will only appear when they're specified:
#       Bn (n=integer, Bending Modes).
#       C0 (diskyness/boxyness), 
#       Fn (n=integer, Azimuthal Fourier Modes).
#       R0-R10 (coordinate rotation, for creating spiral structures).
#       To, Ti, T0-T10 (truncation function).
